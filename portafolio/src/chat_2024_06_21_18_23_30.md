1. **You**: i want to down de opacity of the color: 
```css
 color:white;
```
2. **ChatGPT**: To reduce the opacity of the color white in CSS, you can use the `rgba()` function instead of the `color` property. The `rgba()` function allows you to define a color with red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values.

Here's an example of how you can set white with reduced opacity:

```css
color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
```

In the `rgba()` function, the first three values represent the red, green, and blue color channels, each ranging from 0 to 255. In this case, all three values are set to 255, which gives you white. The fourth value represents the alpha channel, ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 means fully transparent and 1 means fully opaque. Here, the alpha value is set to 0.5, indicating 50% opacity.

You can adjust the alpha value accordingly to achieve the desired level of transparency.
